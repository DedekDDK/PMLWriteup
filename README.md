====================
Welcome to my pages for Machine Learning Excercise.

Unfortunatelly, my R Studio got hanging when I ran the train function, so I am not able to complete the exercise in time,
but I will do my best to complete it as soon as possible (within like 1 or 2 hours), so please take always the latest version
of my files.

###Content
####predictions.R
This file is the main script for creating the learning algorithm for predicting the exercising classes from the training data set.

###codebook.md
This file describes what, how and why I have done with the data and what are the basic parameters of the predictor.
